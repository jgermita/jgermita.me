My new personal site built with [golang](https://golang.org/) and [revel](https://revel.github.io/), deployed on [heroku](https://heroku.com).

This is replacing my old personal site as an exercise to learn more about Go, webservices, and web development in general. This should also provide a nice foundation for future projects and things I've had on the backburner for a few years.
