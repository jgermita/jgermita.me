Sparklecon Smash was a blast. I entered two bots: Sandstorm and Echo. 


### Echo

I initially built Echo in the fall of 2017 as a second attempt to get a 12lb robot running. It had a few minor hiccups, but it was not suitable for combat as it was built. Overweight by over half a pound, 6061 aluminum drum that was already showing signs of damage, and lack of any real armor were just a few issues.

*Echo's first iteration*

Since the announcement of the return of the 12lb weight class to Socal events, I've been designing various upgrades to make Echo competitive. After almost 5 months of on and off CAD work, I settled on a few upgrades:

* 1/8" titanium wedge
* AR500 steel asymmetrical weapon bar
* Major weight loss by replacing 1/4" aluminum side plates with UMHW or thinner aluminum. 

I decided to keep the same drive, controls, and structural systems. 

Echo had a few issues going into the event that I knew would hurt me in the long run. I couldn't spend as much time as I wanted making sure all of the drive ESC settings were tuned in so I had sporadic glitchy drive control at best. I also had a lot of weapon belt issues in practice that I thought I had resolved. (Spoiler alert: I was wrong)

#### Fights

##### Echo vs Bullet

An uneventful fight. Lost the weapon belt early and that same impact caused one of my drive motors to disconnect. Loss via tap out.

##### Echo vs Fork

Fork was in control the entire match. I lost my weapon belt again and was simply outdriven all match. Loss via Judge Decision.

##### 12lb Rumble

I love rumbles. there was just an absurd amount of power kicking around the combined 12/15lb rumble. Echo was working better after some spacer adjustments, but ended up getting high centered on the floor tiles a couple of times. A couple of hits, but ultimately I just wanted to see what kind of damage it could sustain and still drive. It surprisingly took a few blows before finally losing drive chain on both sides. Since my driven wheels are in the rear and my CG in the front, I didn't have much traction to do much of anything. I almost left before the rumble, but ultimately, I'm glad I participated. I was able to get a good look at what kind of damage I should plan for in the future. 

Finish: 7th place, 0-2 record, out in losers bracket first round. 

### Sandstorm

After [Destruction Under the Stars](http://www.jgermita.me/Sandstorm-Event-Report/), I had a lot of ideas for upgrades to Sandstorm. Ultimately, I put Sandstorm up on the proverbial shelf for a few months to figure out where I wanted to go with it.

The upgrades I settled on were:

* Magnets underneath
* Wheel upgrade to the Vex Straight Flex wheels
* Lighter weapon for less gyro dancing
* Single tooth weapon bar
* Remove wedge for better weapon contact
* Different weapon control setup for variable speed

I actually didn't spend too much time on Sandstorm pre-event compared to Echo. Sandstorm just came together nicely.

#### Fights

##### [Sandstorm vs Impact](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/374027699?t=03h19m49s)

I was hoping to have this matchup again. After my match against Impact at Destruction Under the Stars, I wanted to run my new upgrades against Impact to really see how the new upgrades fared. 

Sandstorm worked as well as I'd hoped. There was an arena stick issue caused by the remains of the removed wedge, but other than that it performed how I initially envisioned it. Win via KO.

##### [Sandstorm vs Turbo Dog](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/374027699?t=05h15m02s)

Turbo Dog is a terrifying vertical drum. I was able to stay on the offensive early, but after another arena stick, he was able to get into a better position to OOTA me. Loss via KO.

##### [Sandstorm vs Lynx](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/374027699?t=05h43m18s)

A great match vs a great bot. Lynx eventually went on to win the event, but along the way they showed me exactly where all of Sandstorm's weakpoints were. Loss via KO.

Finish: 5th place, 1-2 record, out in losers bracket round 3.

### Closing thoughts

I'm excited for the event in May. Not quite sure what specific upgrades I'll be making at the moment, but after the damage sustained by both robots, they won't be minor. 

I may edit this post at some point this week to do a full post-mortem on both bots.
