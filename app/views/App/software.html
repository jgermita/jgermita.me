                Created a personal site to showcase the various projects I've completed over the years. The previous
                iteration of this site was hosted statically on Github Pages and the Jekyll framework.

                Score and ranking display for Gryffingear youth robotics events. Built using a Java application running
                on an Apache server. Pulls data from a Google sheet for analysis and display. Currently deployed on a
                Heroku free dyno.

                Platform for the archival and documentation of commonly-used and niche parts in FIRST Robotics
                Competition mechanical and electrical systems design. The foundation of this project is a spreadsheet
                containing information on parts, vendors, applications, etc. The most recent iteration of this project
                involved a Java application that would automatically generate markdown entries for all parts in the
                spreadsheet, to be hosted statically using Github Pages.

                GUI for accessing analytics generated by the <a href="#montecarlo">montecarlo simulator.</a> Built using an incredibly hacky
                combination of windows batch scripts and github static pages to display data generated by a java app.

            <h3>Summer 2015</h3>
            <p>
                An exploration of ideal PID gain tuning using genetic algorithms. Allowed user to specify input
                parameters and ideal conditions to find and simulate ideal PID gains over thousands of iterations. The
                Java application approximated real life physics to simulate system performance over time.

                Java-based simulator and prediction engine for FIRST Robotics Competition Matches. Analytics generated
                were discussed on GameSense S02E08. Results and community discussion can be found here. This was the
                first analysis of its kind to be done on FIRST robotics competition matches.
