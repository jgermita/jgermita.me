                Quick, low budget build for the 2019 LAFTC Coaches' League event. Designed to maybe play the 2012-13 FTC
                Game, Typhoon was the reincarnation of my 2012 FTC robot of the same name.
                It placed dead last in the competition but it was awarded for being the most durable robot at the event.
                Below is a recap video from the event:

                Created a personal site to showcase the various projects I've completed over the years. The previous
                iteration of this site was hosted statically on Github Pages and the Jekyll framework. This current
                iteration is written with the Revel framework in Go, deployed on Heroku with Docker. Content for this
                site is powered by an SQLite database for quick deployment.<br>

                I'm most proud of the <a href="/level5">Combat Robots</a> section that I use to document my robots and fights.
                It reads from information stored in a SQLite database so that I can update information in one table vs modifying
                HTML across multiple pages.

                solution did not exist. Designed in Autodesk
                Inventor and cut using a 130W laser cutter out of Acrylic. Designed during my stint as <a

                Platform for the archival and documentation of commonly-used and niche parts in FIRST Robotics
                Competition mechanical and electrical systems design. The foundation of this project is a spreadsheet
                containing information on parts, vendors, applications, etc. The most recent iteration of this project
                involved a Java application that would automatically generate markdown entries for all parts in the
                spreadsheet, to be hosted statically using Github Pages.

                Designed and oversaw testing for thermal sensors to be evaluated for use in SOFIA instrumentation.

                Using AutoCAD, I designed a test fixture to verify the thermal performance of Off the Shelf thermal
                shutoff sensors. Using plastic bushings, the fixture was optimized to produce minimal change in thermal
                performance of the sensors being tested.

                Coordinated with machine shop to procure materials for, manufacture, and assemble the test fixture.

                Developed detailed test plans to test the sensors under many thermal conditions and atmospheric
                pressures to verify sensor performance.

                Designed as part of my term at the <a href="/me#nasa2">NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center.</a>

            <p>
                Compiled and maintained an aggregate list of parts commonly used in the FIRST Robotics Competition.
                Traditionally, these items and their applications would be scattered across the internet in various
                group chats and forum posts. This project aims to centralize this information for easy reference in the
                time crunch of the robot season.
