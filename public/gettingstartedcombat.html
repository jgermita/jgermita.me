Materials
<br>
3d printing:<br>
• onyx is the best printable material to use for frames<br>
• if you can't do onyx, certain nylons are good.<br>
• TPU is a good compromise for hobby printers but requires some design considerations<br>
<br><br>
2/2.5D machining<br>
• Carbon fiber sheet is very popular for structure.<br>
• UHMW is a great general purpose material that stands up to abuse. It never cracks or shatters. on impact, it just kinda chunks away.<br>
• Avoid polycarb for parts that will get hit. combat people like UHMW and hate polycarb the same way FIRST people love polycarb and hate acryllic<br>
• Aluminum is going out of style rapidly. permanent deformation isn't really worth the rigidity. see UHMW above<br>
<br><br>
Weapons:<br>
• AR400/AR500 are very popular for armor and weapons.<br>
• heat treated S7 tool steel hardened to 54hrc is great for weapons because of how well it holds a sharp edge.<br>
• Ti is good for armor, but is kinda bad on weapons since it's way softer than the above options<br>
• Avoid aluminum for impactor teeth.<br>

Motors/electronics<br>
<br><br>
• for 3lb, these motors are pretty good. different redux options available if you want to go faster/slower.

• I've run them using the vex 29 escs in the past, but those require a bit of work to use. Mostly splitting off the power lines from the pwm connector and sending them to your battery. Guide here

• If you want something off the shelf, fingertech's tinyesc is a solid option, but they ship from canada so things might be a litttle tight time-wise. If you're not planning on a weapon(which I don't recommend with 11 days of dev time), the Spark Minis are bulletproof.

• Consider the D2 kit if that's the direction you guys want to go. they're damn near unkillable, so even just taking inspo from the design will probably be great for a simple bot. It's a turnkey kit that includes everything except the radio, escs, and batteries.

• The D2 wheel and hub assembly is by far my favorite off the shelf wheel setup for combat robots. It's a clamping hub that doesn't rely on set screws. Definitely where I'd start if you don't already have an in-house solution.

• as far as batteries, 3S is a good place to start if you guys already have some intuitive sense of designing drivetrains around 12v. 500mah is plenty for weapon-less bots. These charge fast enough that you can really get away with 1 battery for the entire event, but I recommend at least one spare.

• I like this charger for it. You just have to provide a 12V 5A power supply for it.

• For radios, the AM units are an ok starting point

• But if you want room to grow, the qx7 is a great choice.<br>
